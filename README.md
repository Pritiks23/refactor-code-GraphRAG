# 🤖 Refactor Code Bot: Autonomous Code Maintenance Agent

Refactor Bot is an **agentic AI-powered solution** designed to autonomously maintain and optimize software repositories. Built entirely on GitHub Actions, it functions as a **self-directed collaborator** that formats code, cleans up unused logic, injects license headers, visualizes architecture, and tracks dependencies — all without human intervention.

This project was created for a hackathon focused on **Agentic AI**, where solutions must demonstrate autonomous decision-making and task execution. Refactor Bot embodies this vision by acting as a **digital steward** of codebases, continuously improving them with minimal human input.

---

## 🔨 What It Builds

Refactor Bot is a **fully functional prototype** of an AI agent that:

- 🧠 **Thinks**: Analyzes code structure, dependencies, and history
- 🧹 **Acts**: Executes formatting, cleanup, and documentation tasks
- 📈 **Improves**: Enhances readability, maintainability, and transparency
- 🔁 **Decides**: Chooses what to fix, when to commit, and how to document

---

## ⚙️ Autonomous Workflows

Each workflow is a self-contained agentic task that runs on a schedule or manually. Together, they form a **maintenance ecosystem**:

| Workflow                  | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cleanup-unused.yml`      | Removes unused imports and variables using Ruff and Autoflake            |
| `license-header.yml`      | Injects missing license headers into source files                        |
| `auto-format.yml`         | Formats code with Black, Ruff, and Prettier                              |
| `dependency-manifest.yml` | Generates a dependency tree using `pipdeptree` and commits it            |
| `code-graph.yml`          | Creates module and call graph diagrams using AST and Graphviz            |
| `changelog.yml`           | Parses git history and updates `CHANGELOG.md` using Conventional Commits |

Each workflow **commits directly to `main`**, making decisions and executing tasks without requiring pull requests or approvals.

## 🧠 Agentic Intelligence

Refactor Bot is not just automation — it's **autonomy**. It:

- **Identifies dead code** and removes it
- **Detects missing documentation** and fills it in
- **Visualizes architecture** to aid human understanding
- **Tracks dependencies** to surface complexity
- **Summarizes history** to create living documentation

These behaviors reflect **real-world agentic collaboration**, where AI acts as a proactive teammate rather than a passive tool.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

Refactor Bot addresses challenges faced by every developer:

- **Code rot** from unused logic and inconsistent formatting
- **Missing documentation** that slows onboarding
- **Opaque architecture** that hinders collaboration
- **Untracked dependencies** that introduce risk

By autonomously solving these problems, Refactor Bot becomes a **digital maintainer** — ideal for open-source projects, internal tools, and educational codebases.

## Demo of the Workflows changelog and code-graph: 📊 Code Graph: `code_graph_modules.svg`

The diagram generated by the `code-graph.yml` workflow provides a **high-level module graph** of your project — specifically visualizing the relationships between your Python scripts.
<img width="203" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d645e375-1a1b-49b0-8f67-89148dc4100f" />

Each rounded rectangle in the graph represents a script, and their placement or connections (if any) help illustrate how your codebase is structured.

### 🧱 Design Insights

- **Modular Design**  
  Each script is self-contained and serves a distinct purpose, promoting clarity and separation of concerns.

- **Agentic Behavior**  
  These modules act independently, yet contribute to a shared goal — maintaining and documenting your codebase autonomously.

- **No Tight Coupling**  
  The absence of arrows or edges (if present) suggests that these scripts don’t directly import or depend on each other, which enhances autonomy and maintainability.

This graph serves as **visual proof of your agentic architecture** — showcasing how your AI-powered workflows are modular, autonomous, and purpose-driven.
